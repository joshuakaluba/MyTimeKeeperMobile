# My Time Keeper Mobile

This project is a rewrite of the My Time Keeper application originally only on the iOS app store.

My Time Keeper is a simple time tracking app that allows for multiple timers.

Start the app at the beginning of your shift and keep track of how many hours you have worked in a pay period.

Launch the application before going for a run, create a running timer and keep track of how long you have ran for.

Create as many custom timers as you need and keep track of your time spent on different activities.

The app has a rich interface that enables for easy searching of activities within a specific time frame.

No registration needed, no signing up, everything is stored on device. This is as simple as it gets.

My Time Keeper is available on [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/my-time-keeper/id1232468863) and soon to be on the Google Play Store
